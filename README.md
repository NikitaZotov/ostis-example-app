```

## Build knowledge base

`knowledge-base` is the place for the knowledge base source text files of your app. Put your **.scs** and **.gwf** files here.

Before launching for the first time or after making changes to the knowledge base, you need to build it:

```sh
<path/to/sc-builder> -i kb -o kb.bin --clear
```

## Build problem solver

`problem-solver` is the place for the problem solver of your app. Put your agents here.

Before launching for the first time or after making changes to the problem-solver, you need to build it:

```sh
cmake --preset conan-release
cmake --build --preset conan-release
```

To enable DEBUG set fields in <your-ostis-system-name>.ini:

```sh
log_type = Console
log_file = sc-memory.log
log_level = Debug
```

## Run your ostis-system

To launch ostis-system you should start sc-machine:
```sh
<path/to/sc-machine> -c ostis-example-app.ini \
    -e "<path/to/sc-machine/extensions>;build/Release/extensions"
```
