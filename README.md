## Installation

### Clone repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NikitaZotov/ostis-example-app.git
cd ostis-example-app
git checkout release/0.10.0
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Install Conan

# Use pipx to install conan if not already installed
# Install pipx first using guide: https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/
pipx install conan
pipx ensurepath
# relaunch your shell after installation
```

### Install components

```sh
conan remote add ostis-ai https://conan.ostis.net/artifactory/api/conan/ostis-ai-sc-machine

conan install . --build=missing
cmake --preset conan-release
cmake --build --preset conan-release

cd interface/sc-web
./scripts/install_dependencies.sh
npm run build
```

## Build knowledge base

Before first launch or after changes in KB you should build knowledge base. 

```sh
<path/to/sc-builder> -i kb -o kb.bin --clear
```

## Usage

To launch system you should start sc-machine:
```sh
<path/to/sc-machine> -c ostis-example-app.ini -e "<path/to/sc-machine/extensions>;build/Release/extensions"
```

After that launch sc-web interface:

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 server/app.py
```

To check that everything is fine open localhost:8000 in your browser.
